## About the Project
The goal of this project is to predict flight delay patterns based on scheduled departure and arrival data to improve professional and personal travel planning. The methods used for this analysis are feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), principal component analysis (PCA), and supervised machine learning. <br>

The supervised machine learning algorithms include Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and logistic regression. <br>
